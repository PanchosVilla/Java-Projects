//  Rock, Paper, Scissors. Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rock-paper
//  game. (A scissor can cut paper, a rock can crush scissor, and a paper can cover
//  rock). The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing the scissor,
//  rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and
//  displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or
//  ties. See the sample output, as provided in your textbook.
